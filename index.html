        <h1>When Law & Tech Collide </h1>
          
            
            <div id="paragraph">
            <p>This paper will be examining the benefits of ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) technology and arguing that ADAS technology can make us safer: therefore, drivers should be required, by law, to use it. ADAS technology has made a large impact to public safety on the roads, and therefore, drivers must be made to employ any ADAS features that have been made available to them by vehicle manufacturers. The use of these features must be mandated by the government, as it has a responsibility to protect its citizens from both road trauma, and pollution, through road law and legislation.</p>
           <p>ADAS consist of electronically controlled driver aids which assist in the operation of motor vehicles. These systems have been ranked into six levels of automation as defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers. A vehicle functioning at level zero has no assistance at all; no anti-lock braking system (ABS), traction control, or even power steering. Conversely, a vehicle operating at level five requires no input at all, except for perhaps providing a destination (SAE International, 2014). This means that the vehicle will accelerate, brake, and turn as it sees fit, entirely of its own accord (Taxonomy and Definitions for Terms Related to On-Road Motor Vehicle Automated Driving Systems, 2014). Most of these technologies are developed for use in high-end luxury cars that are generally unaffordable to most of the public; however, as we have seen in the past with features such as cruise control and the like, these systems will eventually trickle down to lower-cost vehicles. So, while self-driving cars may seem extravagant at first, more advanced features will eventually become affordable for the average consumer. This will make reducing the cost of human error more obtainable in years to come.</p>
           <p>Human error is widely agreed upon as the main cause of accidents today. One study by the U.S Department of Transportation shows that 94% of the critical reasons for pre-crash events are attributed to the driver (Singh, 2015). With this information, it is sensible to argue that the elimination of human input would greatly reduce the occurrence of on-road incidents. Lessening the requirement of human involvement in driving would not only result in reduced road trauma; but would also save the Australian economy billions of dollars of tax revenue. An exact figure is hard to estimate, but Michael Bradley - Chief Executive of the Australian Automobile Association claims that road trauma may cost Australian taxpayers almost $30 billion annually (Australian Automobile Association, 2017). ADAS provides answers to the aforementioned issues faced. It has been shown that cars with features including; forward collision warning, blind spot detection, lane departure warning and autobrake, are far less likely to be involved in road incidents (IIHS HLDI, 2020). As these features become commonplace, they will unquestionably decrease the risk of road use, and thus, reduce the cost to human life and the federal treasury.</p>
           <p>Motor vehicles are one of the top contributors to greenhouse gas emissions in the world; this is partly due to the inefficiency of human energy management. ADAS technology is able to mitigate this by bypassing human input. ADAS conserves energy by more closely following ‘eco driving’ practices (keeping the engine in high load – moderate speed situations), by minimizing braking and acceleration cycles and by platooning, where vehicles follow each other closely, thus reducing aerodynamic drag. (Wadud, MacKenzie, & Leiby, 2016). Research shows that autonomous vehicles will outperform humans in almost all aspects of vehicle operation: a study of self-driving ‘mini cars’ by students at the University of Cambridge concluded that autonomous vehicles implementing cooperative driving practices via Wi-Fi were able to improve traffic flow by more than 30% (Hyldmar, He, & Prorok, 2019). This demonstrates that ADAS is able to reduce traffic congestion by using wireless communication to plot more efficient courses, cooperate in an efficient manner with other vehicles on the road and reduce the frequency of on-road collisions, consequently reducing travel time and traffic congestion.</p>
           <p>As ADAS and vehicle autonomy advances, an inevitable trickle-down effect into the mainstream consumer market will occur. This “trickle-down” effect can be observed in many areas of technology. One such example of this is the personal computer, the first PC was sold to the public by IBM in 1981 for roughly $5800 AUD (adjusted for inflation). Today, a far more powerful PC can be purchased for one fifth of that price. This suggests that features that were once expensive and unattainable for some will become common inclusions in the sale of new cars. </p>
           <p>Just as Australia mandated the inclusion of seatbelts in 1971, then mandated the inclusion of ABS in 2003, the government must continue to regulate and standardise the use of safety features on their roads, as it is the responsibility of any government to protect its own people from danger and environmental pollution wherever possible. It is, however, important to note that if too much is done too soon, driving may become inaccessible to a large portion of the population and this can have a largely negative impact to a country’s citizens and economy.</p>
           <p>It is insufficient for the government to mandate the inclusion of ADAS features in newer vehicles. Drivers must be legally bound to use this technology. If a feature such as ABS has been included in a vehicle, then if a situation were to arise where a driver caused a rear-end collision through loss of traction during braking and was found to have switched ABS off, it could be strongly argued they have acted in a negligent manner and have not made a reasonable effort to reduce the risk of operating a motor vehicle, so they may be liable under the law of negligence, which is defined as ‘A failure to take reasonable care to avoid causing injury or loss to another person.’ (Legal Services Commission, n.d.).</p>
           <p>As the evidence presented in this essay reveals, ADAS’ primary function serves to make driving safer and save taxpayers billions of dollars each year. The ability to mitigate environmental impact and travel time are additional advantages of the technology. And so, these tools must be utilised to reduce the enormous risk of injury that drivers confront every day, hence the necessity to mandate the use of the ADAS technology. It is also the government’s responsibility to implement legislation ensuring that newly imported cars include ADAS features, and to mandate the use of this technology so that the driver has a legal obligation to use it. In conclusion, all drivers should be required, by law, to use ADAS technology.</p>
